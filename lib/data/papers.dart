    description: "The ***zip tree*** is a very simple and elegant balanced binary search tree that was invented by Bob Tarjan, Caleb Levy, and Stephen Timmel, in 2017. Mike Goodrich and I asked our students in an experimental algorithmics course to implement the zip tree shortly after it was published. Despite all its simplicity, it had a major flawâ€”it was unbalanced, with one side always deeper. While at a conference in Italy, Mike happened to run across Bob, where they started discussing various methods to make it more balanced. Coincidentally, they had very close-by plane seats on their flight back to New York, and discussed more. Mike, knowing my interest in zip-trees, invited me to join them, and over the next few weeks we discussed and discounted several ideas to improve the balance while keeping a very low amount of metadata. After only a few weeks, we settled on a very simple idea with an elegant proof, performed experiments to 'verify' our theoretical results, and wrote the paper on our new data structure, the ***zip-zip tree***. We also introduced a memory-saving variant called the ***just-in-time zip-zip tree***, and in a journal version introduced the ***external zip-zip tree***. I presented our results in Montreal, where we were presented with my first best paper award.",

    description: "This is the first paper I helped write. I was the TA for an experimental algorithmics course at UCI while Mike Shindler was working on this paper. I helped create questions to evaluate students' understanding, where we discussed how supplementing traditional algorithms courses with experimental algorithmics could lead to positive practical outcomes. The ongoing joke is that I was only added so that the authors would be able to say that they don't discriminate against non-Mikes. The conference was the first I attended, and was conveniently held at UCI that year.",

[Evrim Ozel], a fellow PhD student in my UCI lab, had recently published an experimental paper on a great geographical routing idea that combines elements of _preferential attachment_ (where people prefer to befriend popular people over nobodies), and a geographic model called _Kleinberg's model_, where people prefer to befriend people who are located closer to them. They showed that such a paper produces great empirical results, but were unable to either provide theoretical guarantees nor provide an efficient way to construct such a graph. I joined the team, and for around a year we were unable to make much progress. After nearly giving up hope (on several occasions), I had a breakthrough and was able to prove great theoretical results on a very closely related model. Our decision to submit to COCOA was in no way influenced by our desire to take a vacation in Hawaii. My girlfriend and I had a great time there, also with Mike and his wife, and we won the best paper award from over 70 accepted papers.
